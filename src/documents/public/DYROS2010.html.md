# International Workshop on Dynamic languages for RObotic and Sensors systems (DYROS)

This workshop will take place in November 2010 in Darmstadt (Germany) during the [2nd International Conference on Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots (SIMPAR'10)](http://www.simpar.org/)

## Description
These days, dynamic languages (like [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [Lua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)), [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)), [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [Smalltalk](http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk_(programming_language)), etc, …) are getting more and more popular. Dynamic programming language is a term used broadly in computer science to describe a class of high-level programming languages that execute at runtime many common behaviors that other languages might perform during compilation, if at all: new classes may be created, new modules may appear, software can be adapted very easily to new situation or needs, etc. Most of the time, these languages are also dynamically typed, which some static typing advocates consider a drawback. However, according to advocates of dynamic programming languages, the flexibility of dynamic languages offsets these drawbacks, and even provides advantages so considerable as to make this an essential feature, for example for interactive programming or scripting of complex distributed systems. Dynamic languages features (like reflection, dynamic reconfigurability, scripting facilities, software adaptation, etc.) are almost essential to develop certain applications related to robotics and sensors systems where hardware and software are deeply mixed together. The main goal of this workshop is to be able to discuss about the advantages of using dynamic languages (like Lisp, Python, Urbi, Smalltalk, …) for controlling and simulating robotic system (and also sensors system).

Some examples of existing robotics products based on dynamic programming languages includes: [urbiscript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URBI) an orchestration language for robotics systems, [ROS](http://www.ros.org/wiki/) (Robot Operating System), heavily based on Python and [Pyro (Python Robotics)](http://pyrorobotics.org/) but also now integrated with Urbi, a project designed to create easy-to-use interface for accessing and controlling a wide variety of real and simulated robots.

Topics of interest included but is not limited to:

- domain-specific languages for robotics and sensors networks embedded in dynamic languages,
- using dynamic languages facilities for simulation purpose,
- scripting complex sensors and robotics systems with dynamic languages,
- robotics libraries based on dynamic languages programming languages,
- embedded VM and object models suitable for dynamic languages needs.

## Submissions guidelines
All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity. At least two reviews for each paper will be conducted. We are looking for submission of full research papers and experiences reports (up to 6 pages) and work in progress submissions (up to 4 pages). All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the Easychair website http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dyros10 and should use the IEEE US letter format. We also planned to have a demonstration session.

Papers accepted for presentation in the workshop will be published online with ISBN number in the proceedings of SIMPAR 2010 Workshops. At least one (1) author must register in the workshop to present a paper.
